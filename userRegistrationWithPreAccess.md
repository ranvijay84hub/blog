## User Registration with pre-configured accesses

When user Onboarded into the System using Self Registration or through HR onboarding application,  admin need to set  few pre-requisite access for the same. This we can achieve by making that access request-able for them or grant the same once user onboarded .

There is requirement in some Organization if user is doing Self Registration then access need to 
decide for them as per the domain user's belong to .
